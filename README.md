# E-Commerce with ReactJS
Initially this was an entry in a front-end code challenge, now I plan to develop it as one of my portfolio in MERN stack.

## To Run Application
1. Clone repo "git clone https://github.com/senducusin/e-commerce-turing"
2. cd to repo local directory cd go/to/path
3. Install dependencies by "npm install"
4. Run app "npm run dev"

## About the Project
* Currently using EmotionJS to implement 'styled components' - CSS scoping
* API for the backend will be soon implemented using Nodejs + Express
* Planning to use 'Reach router' instead of 'React router' for simplicity
* Planning to implement Jest for testing
* Currently using 'Parcel Bundler' instead of 'Webpack'

## Dislaimer
* I do not own any of the used/attached images
