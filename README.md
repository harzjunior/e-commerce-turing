# E-Commerce with ReactJS
Initially this was a code-challenge front-end entry in Turing, now I plan to develop it as one of my portfolio in MERN stack.

## To Run Application
1. Clone repo "clone https://github.com/senducusin/e-commerce-turing"
2. cd to repo local directory cd go/to/path
3. Install dependencies by "npm install"
4. Run app "npm run dev"

## About the Project
* API for the backend will be soon implemented using Nodejs + Express
* Planned to use 'Reach router' instead of 'React router' for simplicity
* Currently using 'Parcel Bundler' instead of 'Webpack'
